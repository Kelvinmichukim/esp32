#1. Gather and Label Training Images

#Before we start training, we need to gather and label images that will be used for training the object detection model. A good starting point for a proof-of-concept model is 200 images. The training images should have random objects in the image along with the desired objects, and should have a variety of backgrounds and lighting conditions.

#Watch the YouTube video below for instructions and tips on how to gather and label images for training an object detection model.

#When you've finished gathering and labeling images, you should have a folder full of images and corresponding .xml data annotation file for each image. An example of a labeled image and the image folder for my coin detector model are shown below.
