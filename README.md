The project is aimed at identifying vehicles that cause air pollution by emitting carbon levels that are way above their required threshhold.

Increasing pollution levels due to the presence of unroadworthy vehicles pose significant challenges to environmental sustainability and public health. Unroadworthy vehicles are classified by faulty engines, excessive emissions, or inadequate safety features. The current methods of identifying and addressing polluting and unroadworthy vehicles are often inefficient, time-consuming, and rely on manual inspection processes. To tackle this problem, the integration of IoT devices offers a more reliable approach. By connecting sensors such as PIR motion sensors, NDIR CO2 sensors, and image processing modules, researchers can collect real-time data on vehicle movements, emissions, and overall roadworthiness.

However, several challenges must be overcome, including ensuring sensor accuracy and reliability, processing and analyzing the collected data, achieving seamless integration and scaling of the system for widespread deployment. By addressing these challenges, an IoT-based system can facilitate the identification of unroadworthy vehicles, enabling timely intervention and enforcement measures to mitigate air pollution.
